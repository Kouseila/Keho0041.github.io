        <h2>About Me </h2>
        <p1>I studied English for Academic Purposes (EAP) at Algonquin College and successfully completed all the levels
            of the program. This experience was very important for me because it helped me improve my reading, writing,
            listening, and speaking skills in English. When I first started, I found the language difficult, especially
            grammar and pronunciation, but through practice and support from my teachers, I became more confident.
            Completing all the levels of EAP gave me a strong foundation to continue my academic studies in Canada.</p1>

        <p2>In my current program, I want to continue building my knowledge and improving my skills so that I can
            prepare for my future career. I hope to learn new techniques, work on creative projects, and gain the
            experience I need to succeed in a professional environment. My goal is to become more independent,
            confident, and capable of using what I learn in real-life situations. I believe this program will open
            new opportunities for me and help me reach both my academic and personal goals.</p2>
